We couldn\u2019t agree more. Effective implementation is at the heart of this Act and remains the route through which value will be unlocked into the Nigerian economy\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe PIA aims to incentivize optimality and cost-efficiency and cost-effectiveness in oil production. Different levers such as the cost-price ratio, the replacement of the investment tax allowances, and investment tax credits (which encourage gold plating) with production allowances that reward incremental production have been instituted.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese measures are in addition to industry-wide initiatives already rolled out by the government, which focus on cost reduction and enablers in this regard,\u201d he stated further.<\/p>\n<p>He expressed confidence that with the Act in place, Nigeria is on track in its quest to align with the transit to cleaner energy globally.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from producing liquid hydrocarbons, Gwarzo noted that the country is using its abundant gas resources as a bridge fuel between the fossil of today and the renewable energy of tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/guardian.ng\/energy\/fg-insists-nigeria-on-track-towards-investment-in-oil-gas-sector\/\">Guardian\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Federal Government has stated that the country is currently on track as regards policies and strategies that will turn the country into Africa\u2019s investment hub in the oil and gas industry.
